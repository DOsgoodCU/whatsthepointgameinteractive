Play to have fun--don’t take this too seriously!

You are a farmer…

You have a choice of taking out a loan for quality inputs that would make you much more productive in normal years

But you would lose the farm if there was a drought this year, because you wouldn’t be able to repay the loan

You have a 1 in 5 chance of drought.

We have 5 packages of gum in my hat. 

- The 4 blue ones represent a year with adequate rainfall

- The 1 red one represents a year with a drought

We will randomly draw one of the packages from the hat, and if its red, there was a drought.

We typically add real world prices, etc. to the game
But that’s no fun in a workshop so we will point you to tools to do that later!

But first--make your choice!

- **Put your left thumb up if you take the chance**

- **Put your left thumb down if you stay with your current, low productivity package**

Then, look at your thumb, remember what you chose, and fill out this form:

<!-- Kobo Form Container -->
<div id="game-form">Loading form...</div>

<script>
    // loadKoboForm('ContainerID', 'EnketoID', 'NextPagePath', 'Height')
    // ID 'b5CVmfVW' is for Section 1 (Game Time)
    loadKoboForm('game-form', 'b5CVmfVW', '../peoplesinvestments/', '700px');
</script>
